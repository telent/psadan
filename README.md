# Psadan

One of the indigenous races of the planet Wayland. This race appeared in the last novel of the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn. In The Last Command, they are one of the races that the cloned and insane Jedi master Joruus C'Baoth kept under his rule at the foot of Mount Tantiss.

It's (going to be) a Clojure library that speaks the wayland wire
protocol (eventually).  Right now, it's only on github for people who
want to watch it develop.
